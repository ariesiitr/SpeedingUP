A web Based Game Empowering Developers

The issue of fair rewards for game developers is resolved by Speeding Up, a decentralized game built on the Ethereum and Polygon (formerly Matic) blockchains. Developers frequently struggle to be fairly compensated for their labor and creative efforts in the traditional gaming industry. Even if their game is wildly successful, game developers frequently do not receive royalties or other forms of payment for their work beyond their initial salary or contract payment.

With the help of a fair and open system that rewards game developers based on their game's success, Speeding Up seeks to change this. Speeding Up gives developers the opportunity to earn Matic based on the success of their game, which is distributed via the game's smart contract, by utilizing the Polygon blockchain.

Players of Speeding Up can stake a certain amount of Matic to participate in the game, with four out of every five players winning more than what they stake. This encourages participation from players and creates a fund from which game developers can receive payments based on how well their game is performing. This ensures that game developers are paid fairly for their labor because the game's success is directly related to the rewards they receive.

Additionally, Speeding Up offers a decentralized platform for gaming that is safe, open, and transparent. By utilizing the Polygon blockchain, all transactions are recorded on a public ledger, guaranteeing that the game is fair and open to all players.

 Regardless of a player's prior knowledge of blockchain technology or cryptocurrencies, Speeding Up is made to be accessible to a broad range of players. Players can easily connect their wallets and take part in the game by integrating Metamask.

In conclusion, Speeding Up offers players an engaging, transparent and accessible gaming experience while also offering a fair and open system for rewarding game developers.
